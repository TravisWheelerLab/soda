# SODA docs

We use Sphinx to generate the HTML for the SODA documentation. To build the docs, first install Sphinx.
    
    pip install -U Sphinx

Once Sphinx is installed, you'll need to install the sphinx_rtd_theme from PyPI
    
    pip install sphinx_rtd_theme
   
Next, you can build the HTML by running

    make html
    
Then, open
    
    build/html/index.html
